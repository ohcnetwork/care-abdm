# Design M1, ABHA identity

What the integration has to do to the journey around the calls: how many questions a patient is asked, where a failure is shown, and what a screen is forbidden to claim. Every rule below comes from a Catalogue atom, cited at the end.

## ABDM publishes operations, not a journey

### In plain words

The M1 specification defines around forty operations. It does not say which to
call first, which to skip, or what a screen should ask. That is deliberate: the
same operations serve a hospital front desk, a pharmacy counter, a laboratory
and a patient's own application, and those are not the same journey.

So the journey is the integrator's to design, and a product that knows its own
counter will often beat any default. The rules in this section are the
constraints a good design satisfies, not a design.

That distinction matters when an agent is building. Offer the suggested shape,
say that it is a suggestion, and build what the integrator asks for instead
when they have a view.

### What happens

The suggested shape is one entry rather than a menu. Take one identifier, send
one one time password, and branch on what comes back.

The reason is the branch that creates a duplicate:
asking a person at a desk whether they want to log in or to register puts a
question to them they often cannot answer, and the response already contains the
answer. One screen titled for both outcomes takes the identifier and lets ABDM
decide which journey it was.

A chooser is better where the desk genuinely knows. A counter that only
registers new patients has already answered the question, and making it click
through a combined screen is a step that serves nobody.

Neither is a rule. The rules are the ones that follow in this section: do not
ask twice, do not create before looking, complete without an ABHA, tell the
truth on screen. A design that satisfies those and looks nothing like the shape
above is a good design.

### How you know it worked

Ask the integrator what their counter does before proposing screens. If they
have a view, the built journey matches their view and still satisfies every
rule in this section.

If they have no view, the built journey is the suggested shape, and it was
offered as a suggestion rather than presented as what ABDM requires.

### When it goes wrong

- **The journey is the one the specification implies.** Reading the operations
  in the order they are documented produces a journey nobody designed. The
  order in the specification is an order of documentation.
- **The integrator's own design was overridden by a default.** The default is a
  suggestion. Their counter is the thing that exists.
- **A rule was relaxed to fit the design.** The shape is negotiable. The rules
  in this section are not, because each one was a defect before it was a rule.

## The ABHA step comes before the registration form and fills it

### In plain words

An ABHA is a patient's health account, and a verified one already holds their
name, date of birth, gender, mobile number, full address with its codes, and a
photograph. A desk that reads that profile types almost nothing.

Put the ABHA step first and the registration form opens already filled. Put it
second and you have spent the keystrokes the integration existed to save, then
filed an identifier on top of them.

The test is simple. Count what the receptionist typed. If a registration with an
ABHA took as many keystrokes as one without, the order of the screens is the
first thing to look at.

### What happens

Rank what is scarce at a counter. Calls are cheap. In order of cost:

1. **Questions put to the patient.** A third question costs more than three
   extra HTTP calls.
2. **One time passwords.** They fail, they expire, they lock a transaction, and
   they reach a handset the person may not be holding.
3. **API calls.** Last, and a long way last.

Rank routes by that list in order, and never let a call count outrank a
question.

| Route | Questions | One time passwords | Calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scan and share | 0 | 0 | 0 out, 2 in |
| Create, demographic authentication | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Create, fingerprint | 1 | 0 | 1 to 3 |
| Create, face | 1 | 0 | 3 plus polling |
| Log in, any identifier | 1 | 1 | 3 to 4 |
| Create, Aadhaar one time password | 1 to 2 | 1 to 2 | 4 to 5 |

Two things fall out of that table.

Demographic authentication is one call and spends no one time password. A
government integrator is required to offer it and a private integrator is not
asked for it, so most integrators build the five call route instead, because it
is the one the specification leads with.

The cheapest journey involves no desk call at all. A registered facility with a
callback ABDM can reach can put a QR code at the counter, and the profile
arrives already consented.

Some lookups cost nothing. A login attempt on an identifier nobody holds is
refused `ABDM-1114` before any one time password is sent, so looking before
creating is free for exactly the people you would otherwise send to create a
duplicate.

### How you know it worked

A receptionist registering a patient who brought an ABHA types corrections only.
Every field the profile carries arrives filled, and the only screen asking for
input is the one confirming the form.

Count the one time passwords spent on a full registration. On the demographic
route and on scan and share that count is zero.

### When it goes wrong

- The form opens empty after a successful ABHA step. The profile was read and
  its result was not carried into the form. Hold it in the fact store rather
  than in a screen's own state, which
  the patient fact store covers.
- The desk asks for an identifier it already holds. Same cause, same fix.
- The journey offers login or creation as a question to the patient. They often
  cannot answer it, and
  avoiding a duplicate ABHA explains what to
  do instead.

## Two routes to the profile, and the form is the destination of both

### In plain words

A registration form fills from an ABHA profile. There are two ways that profile
reaches the desk, and they look nothing like each other.

The patient scans a QR code at the counter carrying your facility id and a
counter id, consents in their own application, and ABDM posts the profile to
your callback. Nobody at the desk types anything or asks anything.

Or the desk runs an identifier journey: take an identifier, verify it, and end
holding a token that reads the profile.

Build whichever the deployment can reach. The form is the destination either
way, which is why both belong to the same design rather than being two
features.

### What happens

The share route costs nothing at the counter: no question, no one time
password, no outbound call. It is the cheapest journey in M1 and most
integrations never build it, because it needs a public callback and the
specification leads with the identifier route.

The identifier route is the one to build when the deployment has no callback
ABDM can reach, or when patients arrive without the application. It spends at
least one question and usually one one time password, which is why
the journey order ranks the routes.

Both end in the same place. The form opens filled, the desk corrects rather
than types, and every rule about the form applies whichever route filled it.
A design that treats the share route as a separate feature with its own screens
ends up with two registration paths that drift.

Where both are available, the share route is the default and the identifier
route is the fallback for a patient who cannot or will not scan.

### How you know it worked

Register a patient by each route and compare what the receptionist did. The
share route required nothing beyond showing the code. The identifier route
required one identifier and its verification. Both ended on the same form,
filled from the same profile.

Where the deployment has no callback, the share route is absent from the
journey rather than present and silently failing.

### When it goes wrong

- **The share route is built and nothing ever arrives.** No callback URL is
  registered against the facility, so ABDM has nowhere to post the profile.
  That is a configuration cause for a runtime symptom, and the interface has to
  say so.
- **Two registration forms exist, one per route.** They will drift. The routes
  differ in how the profile arrives, not in what happens after.
- **The share route was skipped because the specification leads with the
  other.** That is the most expensive omission in M1: it is the only journey
  that asks the patient nothing.

## A journey has to complete without an ABHA

### In plain words

An ABHA is voluntary. A person can be treated, registered and billed without
one, and a facility's own patient number is what its record is keyed by.

So a registration journey that cannot finish until an ABHA exists has quietly
decided that people without one are not registered. Nobody chose that. It fell
out of putting the ABHA step first and making the form wait for it. The step
comes first so the form opens filled; it does not come first so the form can be
refused.

### What happens

Decide it deliberately, and write the decision down where the journey is
designed. The question is not whether to offer an ABHA, which every deployment
does. It is what the desk does when the person has none and cannot or will not
create one now.

The answer for a facility record is that the form still completes. The patient
number is the facility's own. The ABHA fields on that record stay empty, and
the surface offers creation again on the next
visit rather than blocking this one.

The ABHA step therefore needs an exit that is neither success nor failure: not
now. It returns whatever facts it collected to the fact store, and the form
opens with those filled and the rest blank, exactly as it would after a
successful step with fewer fields.

Where a deployment does require an ABHA, a government scheme that pays only
against one for instance, that is a rule of the deployment, and it belongs in
the deployment interview as a question with a
yes, not in the screen order as an accident.

### How you know it worked

Walk a patient through the journey and decline the ABHA step at every point it
is offered. The registration completes, the record exists under the facility's
number, and its ABHA fields are empty.

Open the design and find the sentence that says what happens without an ABHA.
It exists, and it was written on purpose.

### When it goes wrong

- **The form will not submit with the ABHA fields empty.** A validation rule
  made the fields required. They are not, unless the deployment interview said
  so.
- **The ABHA step has only two exits.** Success and failure, and a person with
  no ABHA is routed to failure. Add the third exit, not now, and route it to
  the form.
- **The decision was never made.** Nobody can say what the journey does for a
  person without an ABHA. That is this rule failing, whatever the screens do.

## Never ask a patient the same thing twice, enforced by structure

### In plain words

A patient at a counter will be asked for an identifier, and then, two screens
later, for something they already gave. Nobody notices in review, because each
screen reads correctly on its own. It is only the journey that repeats itself.

Discipline does not fix this, because the mistake is invisible at the point it
is made. Structure does. Keep one store of what you know about the patient in
front of you, and generate every question from what is missing in it. A request
to collect a fact you already hold then cannot be constructed.

### What happens

Hold one store per patient, for the length of their visit:

```
facts:      { aadhaar, mobile, abhaNumber, name, dob, gender, ... }
provenance: { mobile: 'from the appointment', name: 'from the ABHA profile' }
tried:      [ { route, why it failed } ]
```

Three rules make it work.

1. **Facts are write once.** Nothing overwrites a fact silently.
2. **A failed route gives back everything it collected.** An Aadhaar typed for a
   login that then failed is already in the store when creation begins.
3. **Screens ask for one missing fact at a time**, and the question is generated
   from the store rather than hard coded into the screen.

Where this bites in practice: a patient identifies by mobile, turns out to have
no ABHA, and creation begins. Creation needs a mobile to attach to the new
account. An implementation that renders a fresh empty mobile field there has
asked the same question twice.

Show provenance. When a field is filled from something you already hold, say so
beside it: taken from what they already gave you, change it only if the new ABHA
should carry something different. A prefilled field with no explanation reads as
a guess.

### How you know it worked

Walk a patient through a route that fails and then through a second route. The
second route asks only for facts the first never collected, and the fields the
first collected arrive filled, each showing where it came from.

Search the interface for a question that is asked in two places. In a journey
built this way there is no such question to find, because the screen cannot name
a field, only request the next missing one.

### When it goes wrong

- A field arrives filled and wrong, and the desk cannot tell why. Provenance is
  missing. Show where each value came from.
- A fact changes under the desk between two screens. Something is overwriting
  rather than writing once. The store should refuse the second write.
- A route fails and the patient is asked everything again. The failed route
  discarded what it collected instead of returning it.

## Ask the integrator about the deployment, not the patient about the journey

### In plain words

M1 has around forty operations and no deployment needs all of them. The routes
do not change from one integrator to the next. The context does: who they are,
what hardware sits on the desk, what their record already holds.

So the first thing to establish is not how the journey should look. It is six
facts about the deployment. Each answer adds a route rather than replacing one,
which is what keeps an integration from branching into a government variant and
a private variant that then drift apart.

### What happens

Ask these six. Each is a yes or a no.

| Ask | A yes adds |
|---|---|
| Are you a government integrator? | The demographic route: one call, no one time password |
| Does your record hold the patient's mobile at check in? | No route. It removes a screen, because the lookup is submitted from the number you already hold |
| Are you a registered facility with a callback ABDM can reach? | Scan and share, which then becomes the default counter experience |
| Is there a fingerprint or iris reader at the desk? | The biometric method |
| Do patients arrive with the ABHA app? | The face route, as a second method rather than a first |
| Which record types does your system actually produce? | The bundles worth generating, rather than all seven |

The answers give the route set. The route set gives the screen set. The
integrator then implements renderers for the screens that survive, rather than
implementing a flow.

The sixth question belongs here rather than with the record work, because
scaffolding all seven record types before knowing which two a system produces is
the most expensive guess available in this integration.

### How you know it worked

You can name, before any screen is drawn, which routes this deployment offers
and which it does not. Every screen in the build traces to a route that at least
one answer switched on, and no screen exists for a route no answer reached.

### When it goes wrong

- The build contains a government branch and a private branch. The answers were
  used to pick a variant rather than to light up routes. Each yes should add,
  never replace.
- A screen exists that no route uses. Something was built from the specification
  rather than from the answers.
- Seven record generators exist and the system produces two. The sixth question
  was not asked.

## An identifier and an auth method are two different questions

### In plain words

M1 looks like five unrelated choices when a screen lists Aadhaar one time
password, mobile one time password, fingerprint, face and demographic
authentication side by side. It is not five choices. It is two questions.

Who is this person, which is an identifier. And how do they prove it is them,
which is an auth method. Every combination the platform supports is one answer
to each.

Ask them in that order and the screen stops being a menu.

### What happens

ABDM works with four identifiers: an Aadhaar number, a mobile number, an ABHA
number and an ABHA address. Not all four reach every path. The profile login
path takes a mobile, an Aadhaar or an ABHA number, and refuses an ABHA address
with `Invalid Login Hint`. An address signs in through the PHR login family
instead, which is the patient's own application acting for them rather than a
facility acting as a provider, so a facility takes such a patient through the
share route.

How the person proves the identifier is theirs travels separately, as
`authMethods`. Its values include `otp`, `demo_auth`, `bio`, `face`, `iris` and
`child`.

So the screen asks for the identifier first. The auth methods go underneath it,
and only where there is more than one, because offering a single method as a
choice is a click that decides nothing. Which methods are available depends on
the identifier and on the deployment: a demographic route is for a government
integrator, a fingerprint route needs a reader on the desk.

The account lookup returns the methods an account actually supports, so a desk
can offer one that will work rather than one that will fail.

### How you know it worked

Count the options on the first screen. It offers identifiers, and the number of
them is at most four and usually fewer, rather than a flat list of every
identifier and method combination.

Pick an identifier that supports one auth method. No method chooser appears.
Pick one that supports several and the chooser appears underneath, listing only
the ones this deployment can actually perform.

### When it goes wrong

- **The first screen lists five or more options.** The two axes were
  collapsed. Split them.
- **A method is offered that the desk cannot perform.** A fingerprint option on
  a desk with no reader, or a demographic option for a private integrator. The
  route set comes from
  the deployment interview.
- **An ABHA address is offered on the profile login path.** It is refused with
  `Invalid Login Hint`. That identifier reaches a different family of calls.
- **A chooser appears with one option in it.** Offer it only where there is
  more than one.

## The six counter screens, and what each is forbidden to ask

### In plain words

Six screens cover every ABHA route a desk offers. Each one declares three
things: what it collects, what it is forbidden to ask, and when it does not
appear at all.

The forbidden column is the one usually missing, and it is the one that stops a
journey asking the same question twice.

### What happens

| Screen | Collects | Must never ask | Skipped when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identify | one identifier | anything already held | the desk holds a mobile or an ABHA number |
| Confirm it is them | yes or no to a masked number | the number itself | no free lookup ran |
| One time password | six digits | the identifier, again | the chosen route spends no one time password |
| Choose an account | which of several | anything the accounts array already carries | there is one account or none |
| Choose an address | pick or type | anything the profile carries | the route issues a default address |
| Confirm the form | corrections only | anything the profile carries | never. It is the destination |

The account chooser is not an edge case. One mobile carrying several ABHA
accounts is an ordinary shared family handset. A journey written as a straight
line from one time password to signed in has nowhere to put the second account,
and finds this out in production.

The last screen is the destination of the whole journey, which is why it is the
only one never skipped. Everything before it exists to arrive there with the
fields already filled.

### How you know it worked

Every screen in the build maps to a row above. For each one you can say what it
refuses to ask, and that refusal is enforced by the fact store rather than by a
comment.

Run a patient whose mobile carries two ABHA accounts. The account chooser
appears, offers both, and asks for nothing the accounts array already carries.

### When it goes wrong

- A second account signs the wrong person in, or the journey stalls. The account
  chooser was not built. It is not optional.
- A screen asks for the identifier again alongside the one time password. The
  screen is naming its own fields instead of requesting the next missing fact.
- The address screen appears on a route that issues a default address. The skip
  condition is not being checked.

## Present the filled form for confirmation rather than saving it unseen

### In plain words

The point of reading an ABHA profile is that the receptionist stops typing. The
temptation that follows is to stop showing the form at all: the data is
authoritative, so save it and move on.

Do not. The profile is what ABDM holds, which is not the same as what the
clinician needs to see. Names may be transliterated into a script the desk does
not use. An address may be years old. A mobile number on a shared handset may
belong to a relative. None of that makes the profile wrong, and all of it
matters at a counter.

### What happens

The confirmation screen collects corrections only. It asks for nothing the
profile already carries, because everything it carries is already on the
screen.

It is the one screen never skipped. Every other screen in the journey exists to
reach this one with more fields filled.

Show which fields came from the profile, so a correction is a deliberate act
rather than a guess. A receptionist who cannot tell a prefilled value from a
typed one will either trust all of it or retype all of it, and both defeat the
purpose.

A correction changes the facility's record. It does not change what ABDM holds:
the profile is the patient's, updated through their own application or through
the profile update calls, not by a desk editing a form. If the desk's copy and
ABDM's copy need to agree, that is a separate update call and a separate
decision.

### How you know it worked

Register a patient whose profile carries a transliterated name. The
confirmation screen shows the profile's value, the receptionist corrects it,
and the facility record carries the correction.

Read what ABDM holds for that patient afterwards. It is unchanged, because a
correction to the form is not an update to the profile.

### When it goes wrong

- **The record is saved without anybody seeing it.** The form was skipped
  because the data was authoritative. Authoritative is not the same as
  appropriate for this counter.
- **A correction silently changed the ABHA profile.** The form was wired to the
  profile update call. Those are different decisions and usually different
  permissions.
- **The receptionist retypes every field.** Nothing distinguished a prefilled
  value from an empty one, so none of them were trusted.

## The branch that creates a duplicate ABHA, and how to close it

### In plain words

The expensive failure in M1 is a person ending up with two ABHA numbers. Nothing
merges them, so the mistake is permanent and the patient carries it.

It is caused by journey decisions rather than by any single call. Four of them
matter.

### What happens

**Every identifier starts on the login path, Aadhaar included.** Wiring Aadhaar
straight to enrolment, because enrolment is where Aadhaar is most discussed,
sends everybody who already holds an ABHA to make a second one.

**`ABDM-1114` is the only answer that means nobody holds an ABHA.** A refusal
that names a field is not the same thing. A stale certificate reads back
identically, and creating an account on that is how the duplicate happens.

**Never ask the patient whether they want to log in or to create.** They often
cannot answer. One screen, titled for both outcomes, takes an identifier and
lets the response decide.

**Read the token, not the account count.** A verification that returns a
`refreshToken` has already returned the final user token, so use it. One without
a `refreshToken` is a short lived transfer token and must be exchanged at the
account selection call, whatever the length of the accounts array. Branching on
`accounts.length` sends the Aadhaar path into an exchange it must not make, and
the refusal then blames the token's shape rather than saying the call was
unnecessary.

Creation is from Aadhaar. ABDM publishes a mobile enrolment route, and an
account created that way is address only and never verified against a
government identity document. No later desk can look it up before spending a one
time password, and the person carries the lesser account permanently. Write that
rule into code as a guard that refuses an unknown method by name, because a rule
the code merely happens to satisfy is one that regresses silently.

When the desk already knows there is no ABHA, ask only for Aadhaar. Offering a
mobile there offers a path that cannot finish. The lookup still runs first: a
patient saying they have never had one is not evidence, and creating on somebody's
word is how the second number appears.

### How you know it worked

Run a login for an identifier nobody holds. You receive `404` with `ABDM-1114`,
no one time password is sent, and only then does the journey offer creation.

Run the Aadhaar login path. The verify response carries a `refreshToken`, the
journey uses it directly, and no exchange call is made. Run the mobile path and
the exchange call is made, because no `refreshToken` came back.

### When it goes wrong

- A login is refused with a message naming a field, and the journey offers
  creation anyway. Only `ABDM-1114` means nobody holds an account. Treat
  anything else as a failure to answer the question.
- The Aadhaar path is refused `Invalid T-token` at the account selection call.
  The journey branched on the account count instead of on `refreshToken`, and
  made a call it did not need to make.
- Two patients a week arrive holding two numbers. Something in the journey is
  creating before it has looked, and the lookup is the cheapest call available.

## Telling the truth on screen at the counter

### In plain words

An integration that overstates its own state is worse than one that reports a
gap, because the gap is then discovered by a patient at a counter rather than by
the person who could have fixed it.

Most of what follows was a defect before it was a rule.

### What happens

**An error must land on the screen the person is looking at.** A multi step
journey that writes a failure into a step the view has scrolled past shows the
desk nothing at all. Resolve the target to the active step rather than to a
fixed position on the page.

**Accepted is not done.** Anything asynchronous has at least five outcomes and
they must not look alike: sent, accepted and waiting, answered, refused before
it ever waited, and no answer inside the window. A refusal shown as a completion
is the worst of the five.

**A silence is not a failure.** Where no timeout is published, say that nothing
arrived in the window you chose, rather than saying it failed.

**Show the masked number the code went to.** A person with two handsets needs to
know which one to pick up.

**A resend button has two jobs either side of one boundary.** While the
transaction still has attempts left, reuse it, because starting a new one throws
away a live transaction. Once it is locked, only a fresh transaction recovers
and retrying cannot. Show a visible wait, because the fastest route to a locked
transaction is somebody pressing resend four times.

**Name the field, not the person.** When an encrypted value is refused, the
cause is usually the encryption, the headers or the clock. Telling a patient
their number is wrong is usually a lie.

Some of this is interface mechanics rather than ABDM, and it still costs real
failures. Off screen is not hidden: a translated step track leaves every step in
the tab order, so the first keypress walks into fields nobody can see, and
inactive steps need marking inert. State from one patient must not survive into
the next, and the field that leaks is always the one the desk typed rather than
the one the profile filled, because every other field is overwritten on the way
in.

### How you know it worked

Trigger a refusal on the last step of a long journey. The message appears on the
step in view, and the desk can read it without scrolling.

Trigger a synchronous refusal on an asynchronous call. The screen says refused,
not waiting, and not done.

Complete a journey for one patient and start another. No field carries a value
from the first, including the fields the desk typed by hand.

### When it goes wrong

- A green state is showing for a refusal. The success and failure paths are
  sharing a function that closes the waiter. Fix it in the shared function, not
  at each call site.
- A one time password transaction locks repeatedly. Resend is starting a new
  transaction while the old one still had attempts left.
- A patient is told their Aadhaar number is wrong when the clock or the
  certificate is at fault. Name the field that was refused and say what else
  can cause it.

## The surface is more than a registration form

### In plain words

Registering a patient is the journey every M1 integration builds first, and it
is not the whole of what the operations support. Several other placements exist,
each answering something a desk is actually asked for, and each arriving later
as a change request when the design did not account for it.

List them for the integrator early. They may choose to build none of them, and
that is a decision rather than an omission.

### What happens

| Placement | What a desk is asked for |
|---|---|
| Find a forgotten ABHA | A patient knows they have one and cannot produce it |
| Upgrade a mobile made address | An account that was never verified against an identity document, and cannot be looked up before an OTP is spent |
| Show the card and the QR code | A patient wants their ABHA on screen or on paper |
| Take a profile shared by QR at the counter | The share route, which is also the cheapest registration journey |
| Update a mobile number | The number on the account is not the one the patient carries |

Two of these are worth deciding early rather than late.

The upgrade matters because a mobile made address is the lesser account, and a
desk that can upgrade it in place is the only opportunity most patients will get.
Creation is from Aadhaar exists so a desk does
not create those accounts; the upgrade is what to do about the ones that exist.

The card and QR are usually the first thing a patient asks for and the last
thing an integration builds, because they are not part of registering anybody.

### How you know it worked

Show the integrator the table above before the first screen is designed. For
each row they say build it, or not now, and not now is recorded.

For each placement built, a patient can reach it from somewhere a receptionist
would look, rather than from a screen that exists only in the registration
journey.

### When it goes wrong

- **Every placement arrives as a change request.** The list was never shown, so
  each one looks like new scope rather than a decision deferred.
- **A patient cannot be shown their own card.** The operations support it and
  the journey has nowhere to put it.
- **Mobile made accounts accumulate with no upgrade path.** The desk stopped
  creating them and never offered the upgrade to the people already holding
  one.
