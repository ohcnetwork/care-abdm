# Deny the consent request raised by HIU from PHR/mobile application

`POST /api/hiecm/consent/v3/request/{request-id}/deny`

Deny a consent request from the Personal Health Record (PHR) or mobile application. By invoking this API, users can reject a consent request, preventing the Health Information User (HIU) from accessing their health data. This functionality is essential for maintaining user control over their health information, ensuring that consents are managed according to the user’s preferences. The API supports secure and compliant health information exchange, enabling users to deny consent requests as needed.

```bash
